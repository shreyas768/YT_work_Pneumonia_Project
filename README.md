# YT_work_Pneumonia_Project

This repository contains the code files for the Pneumonia Project I featured in a video on my YouTube channel. You can find the video walkthrough of the project here: https://youtu.be/Z6MUvVtsR-s

Description :

In this step-by-step project, I walk you through the entire process‚Äîfrom loading the Mendeley Chest X-ray Pneumonia dataset to preprocessing, building the CNN model, training, and evaluating the results with visualizations like confusion matrices and accuracy/loss curves. This is perfect for learning deep learning and medical image classification!

üîç What You'll Learn:

1. How to preprocess chest X-ray images using ImageDataGenerator for data augmentation
2. Building a CNN with Keras (Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dropout, and more)
3. Training the model with callbacks like ReduceLROnPlateau
4. Visualizing model performance with Matplotlib and Seaborn
5. Analyzing predictions with classification reports and sample image outputs
